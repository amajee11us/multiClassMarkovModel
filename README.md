# Markov Networks for Multi-Class Classification
A repository for solving a multi-class classification problem using Markov Networks. This work was done as a part of the MLC challenge at UAI 2023 ([Task](https://uaicompetition.github.io/uci-2022/competition-entry/new-mlc-challenge/)).


## Task

Given an assignment of the Evidence (E) variables, find the appropriate assignment to the non-evidence/ query (Q) variables using the Markov Models provided in the question.

## Execution Details
## Evaluation Pipeline
We use the organizer provided codebase for that purpose.
1. Clone the repository inside the ```src``` directory.
```
    git clone https://github.com/vkomaragiri/VEC.git
    cd src/VEC/
```

2. Install the required dependencies
```
pip install igraph Cython
```

3. Install the package
```
